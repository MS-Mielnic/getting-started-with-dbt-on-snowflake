# playing with dbt on Snowflake

## Overview

This repository contains an example dbt project to get you started with dbt on Snowflake.
I forked it and create a new branch to add some modifications.
It uses a snowflake free account which has a restriction to acces dbt utils and semantic view


What I added so far:
two new marts, one for high value customers and other for truck performances
one manual test

what I will add:
a streamlit site with an interactive viz for my new data
logs visualization
a prediciton model
